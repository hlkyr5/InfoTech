## What do software engineers do?

Software engineers use computer science in conjunction with engineering principles to build software products, games, and run networks. Any time you engage with a computer or smart phone of any kind you are interacting with a software engineer's work. When most people think of a software engineer they typically picture someone in a dark enclosed space typing away on a computer in isolation. However, this is absolutely untrue. Software engineers spend a large portion of their time communicating with clients and collaborating with their peers in order to create the best finished product for their customer.
